#### Challenge
I do not think that this API needs any sort of security testing as it only executes and retrieves the output of ID and PS commands.

Flag format: CTF{sha256}

Attachments: 34.159.7.96:32210
#### Solution


Wrapping the flag with CTF{} we get:
```CTF{791b21ee6421993a8e25564227a816ee52e48edb437909cba7e1e80c0579b6be}```
